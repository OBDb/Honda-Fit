generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The original Honda Fit (sold as the Jazz in some markets) revolutionized the subcompact category with its innovative packaging that maximized interior space within a small footprint. Built on Honda's Global Small Car platform with a central fuel tank layout, it featured the 'Magic Seat' system allowing multiple seating configurations and a flat load floor. Powered by small-displacement four-cylinder engines ranging from 1.2L to 1.5L depending on the market, paired with manual or automatic transmissions, it emphasized efficiency over performance. The interior offered surprising spaciousness for its exterior dimensions, with versatility that allowed it to accommodate items too large for many larger vehicles. This generation established the Fit's reputation for exceptional space efficiency and clever packaging, quickly becoming a global success across various markets."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The second-generation Fit refined the successful formula with more aerodynamic styling, slightly larger dimensions, and improved refinement. The 'Magic Seat' system was enhanced with even more configurations, maintaining the model's class-leading versatility. Engine options continued with various small-displacement four-cylinders, typically ranging from 1.3L to 1.5L depending on the market, with improved fuel efficiency and slightly better performance. The interior featured higher quality materials and more technology features, including available navigation on higher trims. Safety was enhanced with standard stability control in many markets and improved crash structures. This generation further established the Fit as a benchmark in the subcompact segment, combining practicality with enjoyable driving dynamics and Honda's reputation for reliability."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The third-generation Fit featured more angular styling with a strong character line and a more prominent front end. While maintaining similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor, interior space improved further with class-leading rear legroom. The 'Magic Seat' system continued as a key feature, with refinements for even easier operation. Engine options varied by market but typically centered around efficient 1.3L to 1.5L four-cylinders, with hybrid variants available in some regions. The interior saw significant improvements in materials, design, and technology, featuring a touchscreen infotainment system on higher trims with smartphone connectivity. The platform employs ultra-high strength 780 MPa steel for 27 percent of the bodywork, with a shorter overall length by 4cm but a 3cm longer wheelbase and increased rear legroom by 12.2cm compared to the previous generation."

  - name: "Third Generation (Facelift)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The facelifted third-generation Fit/Jazz received significant updates including new bumpers, revised radio with Apple CarPlay integration, and LED headlights with daytime running lights incorporated into the headlight units. The Sport trim was added for the U.S. market, featuring underbody spoiler, exhaust finisher, and orange stitching on cloth seats. Honda Sensing driver assistance features became available on higher trims following the refresh. The hybrid variants continued to be offered with Honda's Sport Hybrid i-DCD system, combining a 1.5L Atkinson-cycle engine with dual-clutch transmission for improved efficiency. Production continued through 2022 across various global markets including Japan, Europe, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and the Americas."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Fit/Jazz features a more rounded, friendly design compared to its predecessor, with a focus on visibility and ease of use. The 'Magic Seat' system continues as a core feature, maintaining the model's exceptional versatility. Powertrain options have evolved significantly, with many markets (particularly Europe with the Jazz nameplate) focusing exclusively on hybrid powertrains using Honda's efficient e:HEV system, which combines a 1.5L Atkinson-cycle engine with two electric motors for impressive efficiency. The interior has been completely redesigned with a more minimalist approach, featuring a digital instrument cluster, simplified control layout, and improved materials. Visibility has been enhanced with thinner A-pillars and a panoramic windshield design. Technology has advanced significantly with the latest Honda infotainment system and comprehensive Honda Sensing safety features standard on most variants. While this generation maintains the practical, space-efficient character that has defined the Fit/Jazz, it also reflects Honda's shift toward electrification as part of its environmental strategy. Note that in 2020, Honda discontinued the Fit in the North American market, focusing instead on the slightly larger HR-V crossover, though the model continues to be sold globally under both Fit and Jazz nameplates."
